Here's the updated README with your information:

School X Project
Introduction
This project aims to provide a comprehensive software solution for managing various aspects of a school environment. 
It encompasses functionalities related to 
    student management, 
    teacher management, 
    course management, 
    section management, 
    semester management, and 
    authentication.

Technologies Used


Java: The project is developed using Java programming language.

Spring Boot: Spring Boot is used to build stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

Spring Data JPA: Spring Data JPA provides repository support for Java applications using the JPA (Java Persistence API) specification.

MySQL: MySQL is used as the database management system.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWT is used for secure authentication and authorization.

Lombok: Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes.

Swagger: Swagger is integrated for API documentation.

Spring Security: Spring Security is used for securing the application.



Getting Started
Database Configuration:

Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
Modify the 
    spring.datasource.url, 
    spring.datasource.username, and 
    spring.datasource.password 
    properties in the application.properties file to match your MySQL database configuration.



Running the Application:

Build the project using Maven or your preferred build tool.
Run the application using the generated JAR file or through your IDE.
Accessing APIs:

Once the application is running, you can access the APIs using the provided endpoints.
Authentication:

The application uses JWT for authentication. 
Access tokens are required to access protected endpoints.
Obtain an access token by authenticating with valid credentials through the /api/v1/auth endpoints.
API Documentation:   

Installation Steps
Clone the Repository: Clone the School X project repository from the source.

bash
Copy code
    git clone https://github.com/Abelo73/School-x.git
Configure Database:

Update the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources directory.
Set the spring.datasource.url property to jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/school_xxxx_2.
Set the spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password properties to your MySQL database username and password respectively.
Ensure that the spring.datasource.driver-class-name property is set to com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver.
Configure other properties such as spring.jpa.show-sql, spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto, spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect, logging.file.name, and debug as per your requirements.
Build the Project:

Navigate to the project directory and build the project using Maven.

bash
    cd school-X
    mvn clean install
Run the Application:

Once the project is successfully built, you can run the application using the Spring Boot Maven plugin.

bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
Access the Application:

The application should now be running. You can access it using the defined endpoints, such as Swagger UI for API documentation, or any other specific endpoints you've implemented.

Additional Notes
Make sure your MySQL server is running and accessible at localhost:3306.
Ensure that the required database schema (school_xxxx_2) exists in your MySQL server.
Modify any other configuration properties in the application.properties file as needed for your environment.
With these steps, you should be able to successfully install and run the School X project on your local environment.

Swagger UI is available at /swagger-ui.html, providing detailed documentation of the APIs and endpoints.
